1. what is the better place to call external api in spring boot
   controller-layer, service-layer, DAO-layer, repository-layer
   
   - In a Spring Boot application, the best practice is to call external APIs in the service layer. 
   
   - The service layer is responsible for implementing business logic and acts as an intermediary between the controller (presentation layer) and the data access layer (DAO/Repository layer). 
   
   - By placing the external API calls in the service layer, you can achieve better separation of concerns and maintain a more modular and testable codebase. Here's a breakdown of each layer:
     
     - **Controller Layer:**
       
       - Responsible for handling HTTP requests, managing input validation, and converting between HTTP and application-specific objects.
       - Should not contain business logic or low-level data access operations.
       - It's generally not recommended to call external APIs directly from the controller, as it violates the principle of separation of concerns.
     
     - **Service Layer:**
       
       - Contains business logic and acts as a bridge between the controller and the data access layer.
       - Ideal place to encapsulate the logic related to calling external APIs, handling responses, and mapping data to application-specific objects.
       - Enhances code reusability, testability, and maintainability.
     
     - **DAO/Repository Layer:**
       
       - Responsible for low-level data access operations, such as CRUD operations on databases.
       - Should not contain code related to calling external APIs.
   
   - Example
     
     ```
     @Service
     public class MyService {
         
         @Autowired
         private RestTemplate restTemplate; // or use WebClient in more recent versions
     
         public SomeResponse makeExternalApiCall(String someParameter) {
             // Build the API URL based on the parameter
             String apiUrl = "https://example.com/api/resource?param=" + someParameter;
     
             // Make the external API call
             SomeResponse response = restTemplate.getForObject(apiUrl, SomeResponse.class);
     
             // Additional processing or validation can be done here
     
             return response;
         }
     }
     ```
