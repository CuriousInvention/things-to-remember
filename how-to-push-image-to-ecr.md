## How to push image to ECR

### what is ECR

Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) is a fully managed container registry service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows users to store, manage, and deploy Docker container images securely.

Key features of Amazon ECR include:

1. **Private Container Registry**: ECR provides a private Docker container registry for storing your container images securely. Images stored in ECR repositories are accessible only to authorized users and resources within your AWS account.

2. **Integration with AWS Services**: ECR seamlessly integrates with other AWS services such as Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), AWS Fargate, AWS Lambda, AWS CodePipeline, and AWS CodeBuild, enabling seamless deployment and continuous integration workflows.

3. **Secure and Scalable**: ECR provides secure storage for your container images, encrypting data at rest and in transit. It is designed to scale automatically to handle large numbers of concurrent image pushes and pulls.

4. **Access Control**: ECR allows you to define fine-grained access control policies using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), ensuring that only authorized users and resources have access to your container images.

5. **Lifecycle Policies**: You can create lifecycle policies to automatically clean up old or unused images, helping you optimize storage costs and maintain a clean image repository.

6. **Multi-Region Replication**: ECR supports cross-region replication, allowing you to replicate your container images across multiple AWS regions for high availability and low-latency access.

Overall, Amazon ECR simplifies the process of storing, managing, and deploying Docker container images, making it easier for developers to build and run containerized applications on AWS infrastructure.

### Process

To push an image to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), you'll need the following details:

1. **AWS Account Credentials**:
   You'll need an AWS account and valid access credentials (access key ID and secret access key) with permissions to interact with Amazon ECR. Ensure that the IAM user or role associated with these credentials has the necessary permissions to push images to the ECR repository.

2. **ECR Repository URI**:
   You need to know the URI of the ECR repository where you want to push the image. This URI typically looks like `<account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/<repository_name>`. You can find this URI in the AWS Management Console under the ECR service or by using AWS CLI commands.

3. **Docker Image to Push**:
   You should have a Docker image that you want to push to the ECR repository. Ensure that the Docker image is properly built and tagged with the ECR repository URI.

4. **Docker CLI or Container Registry Client**:
   You need a tool to interact with Docker registries. This could be the Docker CLI itself or another container registry client. Ensure that the tool you're using is properly configured to authenticate with AWS ECR using your AWS credentials.

5. **Network Connectivity**:
   Ensure that your network configuration allows outbound traffic to the ECR service endpoint. This typically requires allowing traffic to `*.dkr.ecr.*.amazonaws.com` over HTTPS (port 443).
   
   

Once you have these details, you can use the Docker CLI or a container registry client to authenticate with AWS ECR using your AWS credentials and push the Docker image to the specified ECR repository URI. 

- Here's a general example of how to push a Docker image using the Docker CLI:

```
# Authenticate Docker CLI with AWS ECR
$(aws ecr get-login --no-include-email --region <aws-region>)

# Tag your Docker image with the ECR repository URI
docker tag <your-image>:<tag> <aws-account-id>.dkr.ecr.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<repository-name>:<tag>

# Push the tagged image to ECR
docker push <aws-account-id>.dkr.ecr.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<repository-name>:<tag>

```

Replace `<aws-region>`, `<aws-account-id>`, `<repository-name>`, `<your-image>`, and `<tag>` with the appropriate values for your setup.
